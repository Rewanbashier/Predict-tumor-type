project idea: predict tumor type (Benign or malignant)according to features of tumor like radius_mean , texture_mean , perimeter_mean ,area_mean , smoothness_mean , compactness_mean , concavity_mean , concave points_mean .
steps  before model building : 1- read dataset from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gkalpolukcu/knn-algorithm-dataset/data . 2- preprocessing dataset to improve model efficiency : 1- drop unwanted column like id . 2- apply label encoding on output to convert benign and maligant class into 0 and 1.3-split dataset into 70 % training and 30 % testing.4-apply standard scaler on x_train and x_test to help in centering the data and making it more amenable for various algorithms that assumes a standard normal distribution.
steps of model building: i apply four algorithms on the datasets : knn classifier , Bernoulli naive bayes , LinearDiscriminantAnalysis , QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis , knn classifier provide high accuracy better than other algorithms.
